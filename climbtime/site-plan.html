			<h4>History of Climbing</h4>
			<p>Rock climbing began as a necessity for hunters and explorers but transitioned into a sport in the late 1800s. European climbers in the Alps and the UK’s Lake District started climbing for recreation, while in Fontainebleau, France, mountaineers trained on boulders without considering it a separate discipline.</p>
			<p>In the early 1900s, climbing gained popularity in places like Yosemite, the Dolomites, and the Peak District. Fontainebleau climbers refined bouldering techniques, though it was still seen as training rather than a sport.</p>
			<p>By the 30s and 50s, advances in climbing gear allowed climbers to push their limits. In the U.S., John Gill introduced gymnastics-based movement to bouldering, treating it as a discipline of strength and skill rather than preparation for larger climbs.</p>
			<p>In the 60s and 70s, Yosemite became a climbing hotspot with figures like Royal Robbins and Warren Harding pioneering big wall ascents. Bouldering grew in Fontainebleau and the U.S., but it remained a niche compared to traditional climbing.</p>
			<p>The 80s saw sport climbing rise, especially in France, where bolted routes encouraged a focus on difficulty. This led to an increase in climbing gyms. Bouldering also gained recognition, with more climbers treating it as a standalone pursuit.</p>
			<p>By the 90s and 2000s, climbing gyms became widespread, and competitions grew. Bouldering, led by climbers like Fred Nicole and Chris Sharma, reached new difficulty levels and solidified its place as a distinct discipline.</p>
			<p>The 2010s saw climbing explode into mainstream culture, with indoor gyms booming and outdoor climbing destinations drawing more enthusiasts. Bouldering competitions became as prestigious as lead climbing, and sport climbing debuted in the 2021 Tokyo Olympics.</p>
			<p>Today, both rock climbing and bouldering continue to evolve, with climbers pushing boundaries in difficulty, style, and accessibility.</p>

			<h3>Climbing Info</h3>
			<h4>Holds, Equipment, Lead Mistakes</h4>
			<h5>Holds</h5>
			<p>Jugs - These are the easiest to hold onto, as they are large and have a lot of surface area.</p>
			<p>Crimps - These have very little surface area and are usually small, making them difficult to hold onto.</p>
			<p>Slopers - These are smooth and rounded, making them hard to hold onto.</p>
			<p>Pinches - These are holds that you have to pinch between your fingers and thumb.</p>
			<h5>Equipment</h5>
			<p>Shoes - Shoes are important in climbing because you need to be able to toe, heel hook, and toe hook in order to make it through tough climbs</p>
			<p>Chalk - Chalk is used to keep your hands dry, which is important because if your hands are sweaty you can slip off of holds</p>
			<p>Harness - A harness is used to keep you safe while climbing, as it is what you attach the rope to</p>
			<p>Rope - The rope is what keeps you safe while climbing, as it is what you clip into the wall with</p>
			<p>Carabiners - Carabiners are used to clip the rope into the wall, and are what you clip the rope into when you fall</p>
			<p>Quick Draws - Quick draws are used to connect the rope to the bolts on the wall. They consist of two carabiners connected by a piece of webbing. One carabiner clips to the bolt, and the other clips to the rope, allowing the rope to run smoothly through the protection points.</p>
			<h5>Lead Mistakes</h5>
			<p>There are a few common types of mistakes when lead climbing that can be very dangerous. These include:</p>
			<p>Back Clipping - This is where you clip the bottom portion of the rope on the front of the carabiner, which can allow the rope to unclip in the event of a fall</p>
			<p>Z Clipping - This is where you clip the rope through the carabiner in a zig-zag pattern, which can cause the rope to get stuck, and can keep your last point of protection lower than you think</p>
			<p>Back Stepping - This is what happens when you put your foot behind the rope, which can cause your head to fall down and possibly hit the wall if you fall.</p>
